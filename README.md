# 🛴 Scooter Rental Analysis

A comprehensive exploratory and statistical analysis of scooter rental data to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights influencing ride demand.

## 📊 Overview

This project investigates temporal and environmental factors affecting scooter rental usage. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis dives deep into the dataset to:

- Explore demand patterns across different hours, weekdays, and seasons.
- Evaluate the impact of weather conditions (temperature, humidity, windspeed) on ride frequency.
- Visualize trends using intuitive, informative plots.
- Draw actionable conclusions to support decision-making for scooter fleet management and operations.
